# Python-Guessing-Game

Instructions:
Make sure your script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.
For example, non-number guesses should be handled with an exception.

As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message.
A random number should be chosen that is within the range.
As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.
As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.
As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.
When the game ends, an ending message is shown to the player.

Exceeds Expectations Grade:
As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.
For example, if the range is 1-10 and the player enters 12 they should be informed that this number is outside the range.

As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.
As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points) so that I know what I am supposed to beat.
Every time a player decides to play again, the random number to guess is updated so players are guessing something new each time.
